<div style="font-size: 36px; text-align: justify; width: 60%; margin: 0% 20% 0% 20%;">

Here is an overview of some general documentation categories.

Some of these categories belong to specialized people/groups. Creating and maintaining these should be supported via collaboration & automation, such as GitHub Actions/Apps

Note:

This can be a rabbit hole, do not get "consumed" by your documentation efforts. Collaborate with specialized teams

What parts of docs are portable vs. github-specific (Git vs GitHub)

- General explanation of the project (for anyone)
- How to use the project (for consumers)
- What restrictions exist for the project (for consumers)
- How to develop the project (for contributors)
- How to ask questions and make suggestions (for community members)
